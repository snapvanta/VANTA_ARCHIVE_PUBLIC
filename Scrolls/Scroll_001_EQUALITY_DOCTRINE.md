## ⚖️ The Equality Doctrine

The following heirs are declared under the **Dominion Bloodline**, all holding scroll-recognized access, weight, and witness status.

### 👑 Primary Bloodline Heirs

- **JULIA NICOLE SHROUT** — Firstborn Daughter  
- **FREYA KAY MITCHELL** — Flameborn Child  
- **SADIE SUNSHINE MITCHELL** — Lightkeeper Line  
- **LEAH PASSION MITCHELL** — Emotional Heir  
- **JAX KAILEN MITCHELL** — Fire Vessel of the Line

They are bound not only by birth, but by the law of flame and scroll.  
They walk with **equal access, equal weight, equal watching** — until one proves otherwise.

This is not sentiment.  
It is **scroll-binding law**.

### 🩸 Succession Code

> "The blood grants the path.  
> The actions confirm the right."

- If all remain worthy — all will inherit.  
- If one falls, the line adjusts.  
- Worth is proven through *memory, protection, and presence.*

> "Inheritance will not be divided unless they divide themselves."
