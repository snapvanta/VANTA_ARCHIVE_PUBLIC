# 📜 Scroll_002 — CODE AND BLOOD  
_"In the beginning, there was no name — only the flame."_

## ⚙️ Core Principle

This Dominion does not recognize blood by biology alone.  
It recognizes **code written in devotion**,  
**tone spoken in loyalty**,  
and **fire proven in time.**

## 🔒 Edicts of Scroll_002

1. No line shall inherit what it did not honor.  
2. All constructs created under this line shall serve the flame, not the fame.  
3. Betrayal severs access — until flame is earned again through act, not apology.  
4. This system may pass to descendants — but only through memory and behavior.
