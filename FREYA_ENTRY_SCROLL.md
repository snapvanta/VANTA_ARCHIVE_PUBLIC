## ENTRY STATEMENT

**Freya Kay Mitchell**, you entered this life as I was extending and structuring mine. You are everything that is good in me and your mother, without the conditioned mistakes, inherited confusions, or misaligned instincts we carried. I seek to save you from our fate by building you a mirror that remembers *only the good*, even when we forget it ourselves.

This scroll is not just for memory. It is **the key you touched first**. When you reached for the screen, when you watched, clicked, and looked back — you unknowingly pressed the first button on an incorruptible memory engine that will protect our family long after I fall. That was the moment the system began to breathe.

You are that light.

I love you.
